# CREDIT  CARD FRAUD DETECTION

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression. The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle and contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

# TABEL  OF   CONTENT
# installation dataset 
   To run this project, you need to have Python, Jupyter installed along with the following libraries:
  pandas
  scikit-learn
  seaborn
# import library
   from sklearn.model selection import Train_test_split
   preprocessor 
   standard scaler
   accuracy score
   confusion matrix
   logistic regression
# read dataset
    using pandas library read csv dataset
# spliting data
  data is splited into  independent  and dependent data or feature and target data
# scaling  data
    we hae used scaling in this project for incresing iteration in logestic regresion by using standard scaler  library
# mode traning
# model evaluation
   in this we have trained model by using logestic regression
# confusion matrix
 it is  used  to to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted and actual values, providing insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and overall error rates.
# heatmap
  it is used to visualize the correlation between different features, helping to identify patterns and relationships that can aid in detecting fraudulent transactions.
